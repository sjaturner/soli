# A recursive solver for the Solitaire game

I found this in an archive. I must have written it about 25 years ago for a DOS 
machine. I remember that, at the time, my PC at work was an Apricot machine with 
a 386 SX processor. A bit like this: http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/15816/Apricot-XEN-i-386-45/ 
but without the funky LCD screen keyboard.

It took about eight hours to solve the Solitaire - I left it running overnight.
